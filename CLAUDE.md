# Agentic Legibility Stack

## What is this project?

A Turborepo monorepo implementing a reference architecture for UK government services accessed through AI agents. It demonstrates how citizens can interact with gov services via chat while maintaining full transparency and auditability.

## Project structure

```
apps/
  citizen-02/           → Standalone citizen app with bundled data (Next.js, port 3102)
  citizen-experience/   → Citizen-facing chat + auth UI (Next.js, port 3000)
  legibility-studio/    → Admin dashboard for services, traces, gap analysis (Next.js, port 3001)

packages/
  adapters/     → LLM + MCP client integration (Anthropic SDK lives here ONLY)
  evidence/     → SQLite append-only store for traces + receipts
  identity/     → User identity and authentication
  legibility/   → State models and legibility logic
  mcp-server/   → Local MCP server exposing service JSON artefacts as tools
  personal-data/→ Personal data handling
  runtime/      → CapabilityInvoker and runtime orchestration
  schemas/      → Shared TypeScript schemas

data/
  services/*/   → manifest.json, policy.json, state-model.json, consent.json per service
  simulated/    → test-users.json, wallet-credentials.json
  traces.db     → SQLite evidence store (created at runtime)
```

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start both apps in dev mode
- `npm run build` — build everything
- `npm test` — run tests across all packages (vitest via turbo)
- `npm run seed` — seed the traces database

## Architecture rules — IMPORTANT

- ALL service calls route through `CapabilityInvoker` in `@als/runtime` (single choke point)
- ALL LLM calls go through `AnthropicAdapter` in `@als/adapters` — zero direct Anthropic SDK usage elsewhere
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` lives in `@als/adapters` ONLY
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` CLIENT usage lives in `@als/adapters` — SERVER usage lives in `@als/mcp-server`
- legibility-studio fetches evidence from citizen-experience API (`http://localhost:3000/api/traces`) — it does NOT import `@als/evidence` directly

## Build gotchas — READ BEFORE CHANGING DEPENDENCIES

- `serverExternalPackages: ["better-sqlite3"]` is required in BOTH Next.js configs — do not remove
- Do NOT add `@als/evidence` as a dependency of legibility-studio — it causes lru-cache/native module crashes. Studio fetches via HTTP instead.
- MCP tool types need `as unknown as Array<Record<string, unknown>>` cast for the adapter interface

## Testing — IMPORTANT

- After making changes to any package, run `npm test` before considering the work done.
- Tests use Vitest with workspace configuration — each package has its own `vitest.config.ts`
- Never make real API calls in tests — mock external dependencies (Anthropic SDK, databases)
- Evidence tests use an in-memory DatabaseAdapter, not real SQLite
- citizen-02 has unit, component, and API route tests (54 tests across 6 files) plus Playwright E2E smoke tests
  - Component tests use `@testing-library/react` with `@vitejs/plugin-react` for JSX transform
  - API route tests use `// @vitest-environment node` override
  - Mock Zustand store via `vi.mock("@/lib/store")` in component tests
  - E2E: `cd apps/citizen-02 && npx playwright test` (requires dev server on port 3102)

## Environment

- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env variable for LLM functionality
- Node.js with npm workspaces
- Package manager: npm
